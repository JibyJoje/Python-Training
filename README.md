## <u>Basic Terminology and using IDLE </u>

- <b> Expression </b> - Every expression constitutes of values and operators, e.g. ( 2 + 5) and the expression evaluates to give us another single value.
- <b> Operators </b> - Any operation that must be performed on a given value are called as operators. Some of the operators that are supported in Python are as listed below.

     * Arithmetic operators (+ - * / // % ** )
     * Assignment operators (=)
     * Comparison operators (==, <, >, <=, >=, !=)
     * Logical operators (and or not)
     * Identity operators (is, is not)
     * Membership operators (in, not in)
     * Bitwise operators (&, |, ~, ^)
     
  <b> Note:</b> The operators are calculated in the order of precedency where Multiplication and Division are operated first and then Addition and Subtraction. 

- <b> Data Type </b> - Every value that is written in the Python programming language has an Data Type associated with it. The most common types of Data Types are as listed below:

	* String - str
	* Numeric - int, float
	* Sequence - list, tuples, range
	* Mapping - dict
	* Set - set
	* Boolean - bool 
 
- <b> Variables </b> - You can store the values in memory by using variables and you can assign the values to these variables using the assignment operator (=).
