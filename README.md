## Basic Terminology and using IDLE 

- <b> Expression </b> - Every expression constitutes of values and operators, e.g. ( 2 + 5) and the expression evaluates to give us another single value.
- <b> Operators </b> - Any operation that must be performed on a given value are called as operators. Some of the operators that are supported in Python are as listed below.

     * Arithmetic operators (+ - * / // % ** )
     * Assignment operators (=)
     * Comparison operators (==, <, >, <=, >=, !=)
     * Logical operators (and or not)
     * Identity operators (is, is not)
     * Membership operators (in, not in)
     * Bitwise operators (&, |, ~ ^)
     
  <b> Note:</b> The operators are calculated in the order of precedency where Multiplication and Division are operated first and then Addition and Subtraction. 

- <b> Data Type </b> - Every value that is written in the Python programming language has an Data Type associated with it. The most common types of Data Types are as listed below:

	* String - str
	* Numeric - int, float
	* Sequence - list, tuples, range
	* Mapping - dict
	* Set - set
	* Boolean - bool 
 
- <b> Variables </b> - You can store the values in memory by using variables and you can assign the values to these variables using the assignment operator (=). 


## Boolean Expressions and Operators:

- **Boolean Expressions** - Boolean Expressions can contain either 'True' or 'False'.
- **Boolean Operators** - Boolean Operators are expressions that can evaluate to a Boolean Value i.e. 'True' or 'False'. The Boolean Operators or the Logical Operators are **And, Or and Not**

### The 'OR' operator Truth Table:

| Expression | Evaluates to  |
|--|--|
| True or True | True  |
|True or False | True |
|False or True| True|
|False or False| False|

### The 'AND' operator Truth Table:

| Expression | Evaluates to  |
|--|--|
|True and True | True|
|True and False | False|
|False and True | False|
|False and False| False|

### The 'NOT' operator Truth Table:

| Expression | Evaluates to  |
|--|--|
|not True | False  |
|not False | True |

## Conditional Statements:

### if, else and elif Statements:

- **if Statement** - The **'if'** statement is used to check if the variable matches a particular value or not. If the expression evaluates to **'True'** then the block of code under the **'if'** statement is executed. 

- **else Statement** - The **else** statement is used if you want to have more than one condition to be checked. If the expression evaluates to **'True'** then the block of code under the **'if'** statement is executed. Otherwise the block of code under the **'else'** statement is executed. 

- **elif Statement** - The **elif** statement is used when you need to have multiple i.e. more than two conditions to be checked. The block of code that evaluates to **'True'** is executed.
